# Wheather_Prediction_Project

# Overview

This project focuses on predicting weather conditions using machine learning models. It leverages historical meteorological data to forecast parameters like temperature, wind speed, and precipitation. The application aims to provide accurate weather predictions to support decision-making in agriculture, transportation, and daily planning.

# Features

. Predicts temperature, humidity, wind speed, and rainfall likelihood.

. Uses advanced machine learning  Linear Regression algorithms

. Supports visualizations of weather trends for better analysis.

. Provides real-time weather prediction (integrated with APIs).

# Dataset

Source: Link to Dataset (e.g., Kaggle, NOAA, or custom-collected data).

Description: The dataset contains historical weather data with fields like:

. Temperature

. Wind speed

. Precipitation level

# Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn


# Tools:

Jupyter Notebook

# Modeling Approach

1. Data Preprocessing

. Handle missing values.

. Normalize numerical features.

. Convert categorical data (e.g., weather type) into numerical form.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

. Analyze trends in temperature, humidity, and rainfall over time.

. Visualize correlations between different features.

3. Model Training

. Algorithms:

  Linear Regression for temperature prediction.

5. Evaluation

. Metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), RÂ² Score.
