# Wheather_Prediction_Project

# Overview
This project predicts weather conditions using machine learning models and integrates the predictions with a Django web application. Users can input parameters or view weather trends through an intuitive web interface. The system is designed to make weather forecasts accessible to a broader audience.

#Features

.Predicts temperature,  wind speed, and rainfall likelihood.

.Machine learning integration with Django for real-time predictions.

.User-friendly web interface for inputting data and viewing results.

.Interactive visualizations of historical weather trends and forecasts.

# Dataset
. Source: Link to Dataset (e.g., Kaggle, NOAA, or custom-collected data).

. Description: The dataset includes the following fields:

Temperature

Wind speed

Precipitation level

# Technologies Used

-> Backend

. Django: Python-based web framework for the application.

. Django REST Framework: For API integration .

->Machine Learning

Python with the following libraries:

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn


-> Frontend
HTML

CSS

JavaScript

Bootstrap for styling


# Integration with Machine Learning Model

1. Train Your Model

   . Prepare and save your machine learning model as a .pkl file:
  
2. Load the Model in Django

    . Place the weather_model.pkl file in your Django project directory.

3. Create Forms and Templates
